# Shut the Box
Shut the box is a quick, dice game that is typically played in a group of 2 to 4 people.
The objective of the game is to accumulate the least amount of points or "shutting the box."
Shut the Box was created roughly 200 years ago, and I have recreated the game in Python for
easier portability, solo-play, and level-up functionality.

## Motivation
I wrote the code in my free time in order to apply skills I am currently developing in my studies
and create a fun game I enjoyed playing with my peers in high school.

## How to Run/Play
- Download an IDE or have some method to run Python files
- Place the files in the same directory(Create a folder)
- Run shut_the_box.py in the IDE
- Create a player and have fun!

## What is Included?
- Singleplayer and Local Multiplayer
- Level-Up System(with Prestige)
- Betting System(No real-world currency)
- Difficulty Settings for Singleplayer
- Additional Multiplier for Higher Difficulty Settings
- Creating Character Codes to Transfer Progress from Another Device
